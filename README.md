## Overview

### Description

This website is a game where the object is to repeat a series of random tile clicks created by the
game. After each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex which
makes it harder to remember. Youâ€™ll have four different tiles, each with a unique color and sound
which is activated when pressed. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of
colors/sounds randomly generated by Simon, it's an endless game!
